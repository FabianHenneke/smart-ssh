============

smart-ssh uses [bower](https://bower.io/) to manage its dependencies.

## Building
Run `build.sh`. This will
  1. install bower dependencies,
  2. download the [Google Smart Card Client library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromeos_smart_card_connector/releases),
  3. copy all resources into the `build` folder,
  4. compress the contents of the `build` folder into a ZIP file.
In order to load the extension into Chrome, activate `Developer mode` on `chrome://extensions` and select the `build` folder after clicking on `Load unpacked extension...`.
